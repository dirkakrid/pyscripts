# fireprotocol
Repository for fireprotocol.com

Here I will try to work on my ssh python scripts.
Right now there is no clear picture on what exactly we want to achieve but the goal ultimately is to have a repository of python scripts that we can use to facilitate our daily networking tasks at work.

I will start by creating a script to establish an ssh connection to a particular box and get some desired information.

We will see where this journey takes us.
